* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
We started Python this week. I learned about data structures, algorithms, & recursion with python. Also scripting.
* What excites or interests you about coding?
The ability to build something customers love using.
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
Learning how to build a full fledged back-end using Node.js and MongoDb. We needed to create groups for an apartment based app. Managing the complexity of maintaining groups & connecting users to certain groups, and passing up the information cleanly to the front-end was quite difficult.
* When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance?
I was implementing a meeting tool & I wanted to make the website live updating. I learned how to implement socket.io, which helped me make the site update for all users that were using it.
* Can you describe some SEO best practices or techniques you have used lately?
I always try my best to include as many keywords as possible in the main body text of what ever website I'm creating. The other thing is that I try to keep as few javascript modules on the landing page as possible, so that way the google site speed rating is higher, which in turn optimizes our results.
* Can you explain any common techniques or recent issues solved in regards to front-end security?
I implemented Google OAuth on my most recent project. I prefer this to regular OAuth because it's easier for the end-user (less clicks) & it's secure on our backend.
* What actions have you personally taken on recent projects to increase maintainability of your code?
I make an effort to comment all my code & clean it up so anyone can read it. That's really important to me.
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
I love the MERN stack, although I am not opposed to using Postgres based databases.
* Which version control systems are you familiar with?
Github
* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?
I start with drawing up outlines on pen & paper. Then I figure out all the things I need for the models in my database. From there I build out a working version of the backend & then the frontend.
* If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?
By importing them in the relevant React pages. I also would keep them in separate folders that are relevant.
* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
* How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?
* How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
  * What are the exceptions?
* Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time).
* If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?
* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
* Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.
* What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?
* Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.
* Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.
* What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
* How did you handle a disagreement with your boss or your collaborator?
* What resources do you use to learn about the latest in front end development and design?
* What skills are needed to be a good front-end developer?
* What role do you see yourself?
* Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?
